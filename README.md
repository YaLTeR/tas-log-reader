# TAS Log Reader

View TAS log files produced by [Bunnymod XT]. Proof-of-concept GTK 4 version of [qconread2].

[`example-tas-log.log`](example-tas-log.log) is an example TAS log file that this app can read.

This app serves as a decent test case for diagnosing the [scrolling performance](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/issues/3334) and perhaps for data table style updates too.
